llgal is an easy and fast on-line gallery generator based on iGal.
Its primary goal is to NOT require any boring useless expensive feature
in your webserver, such as PHP, JavaScript, SQL, ...

Thus, llgal generates static web-pages.

llgal installation instructions
===============================

You don't care about this if you use Debian or Gentoo or any other
distribution that includes prepackaged llgal versions.

Run 'make' followed by 'make install' as root.
*Both* command-lines must use the same variables for configuring
installation paths.

By default, everything is installed in /usr/local/.
Most directories might be changed by overriding their default values
on the command-line.
For instance, a traditional installation (binary in /usr/bin, data in
/usr/share, and configuration in /etc) might be achieved with:

$ make PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man LOCALEDIR=/usr/share/locale
$ make install PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man LOCALEDIR=/usr/share/locale

If you don't want or can't install as root, you may use

$ make PREFIX=/home/login/where/you/want
$ make install PREFIX=/home/login/where/you/want

Note that 'make uninstall' (with same options) allows to uninstall.

llgal requirements
==================

llgal requires perl and imagemagick packages.
The following perl libraries are also needed:
* Image::Size
* URI
* Locale::gettext
These dependencies are automatically installed when installing
Debian or Gentoo prepackaged versions.

Additionally, some options (--cc, --ct and --exfi) require the following
library to extract tags from images:
* Image::ExifTool
If not installed, llgal with work fine as long as none of these options
is used. When on is called, llgal will issue an error message advicing
to install the library.


If you need to install these libraries by yourself, you may
for instance find them on CPAN:
* http://search.cpan.org/~exiftool/ for Image-Exiftool
* http://search.cpan.org/~rjray/ for Image-Size
* http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/ for URI
* http://search.cpan.org/~pvandry/ for gettext
