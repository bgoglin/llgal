Description: Command-line online gallery generator
 llgal is a online gallery generator for images, videos, ...
 It is based on igal and adds multiple features including:
  - various types of slides (movies, text, links, downloads and subdirs);
  - addition of headers, footers, links and separators in generated HTML files;
  - automatic generation of captions from JFIF, GIF or EXIF tags;
  - highly configurable layout.
 The llgal interface is command line only. Its purpose is to generates
 nice web-pages quickly, using very simple but standard XHTML/CSS code,
 without requiring anything like php or javascript.
