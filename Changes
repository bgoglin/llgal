llgal (0.13.18)

  * Fix slidenames for subgalleries when -n is used
    (reported by Richard Betham in Debian bug #652929).
  * Fix the recognition of existing captions file entries when filenames
    contain special characters.
  * Check whether there is a user-given thumbnail before listing as links
    when -L is given.
    Thanks to Gabor Kiss for the patch in Debian bug #683809.
  * Make --cf work with subdirectory entries by not removing the extension
    and just using the entire directory name (reported by Bruno Raoult).
  * New option (thumbnails_dimensions_from_css) to avoid any thumbnail
    dimension in generated HTML.
  * Add support for replacing <!--EXIF-*--> with the corresponding Exif
    tag in the slide template. Thanks to Charles Nepote.
  * Really initialize exiftool only once per gallery.

llgal (0.13.17)

  * Fix the description of -n in the manpage (thanks Paul Menzel
    in Debian bug #579096).
  * Fix miscellaneous typos everywhere, reported by Debian's lintian.
  * Adapt default convert command-line for graphicsmagick compatibility
    (reported by Kenyon Ralph in Debian bug #604106).

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Tue, 02 Aug 2011 12:31:00 +0100

llgal (0.13.16)

  * Add exifdesc to --cc to generate the caption from the Exif image
    description (thanks Fmiser).
  * Add LNKNOSLIDE: entry support for direct links without slide, as if
    LNK_link_to_target was set to 1 (requested by Nathalie Furmento).
  * Add --nf and slide_link_to_full_image to remove links from scaled
    images in slides to full unscaled images (thanks Maximilian Wilhelm).
  * Display Exif coordinates in decimal format (thanks Fmiser).
  * Fix typos in the german translation (thanks Nadar).
  * Fix replacing of <!--CSS--> (thanks Steffen Klatt).
  * Fix support for filenames with initial dash character in convert
    command-lines (thanks Tiago Bortoletto Vaz in Debian bug #570553).
  * Fix PARENT and PREV/NEXT links between galleries, honor user changes
    in the captions file instead of overriding with the default values
    (reported by Gerfried Fuchs in Debian bug #478699).
  * Clarify in the manpage that replacing <!--FOO--> variables will never
    automatically add double-quotes (requested by Samuel Thibault).
  * Document better how to provide custom thumbnails and scaled images
    using mythumb_ and myscaled_ prefixes.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sat, 27 Feb 2010 20:46:00 +0100

llgal (0.13.15)

  * Thumbnails now always point to the slide, even if it just contains
    a link to a file, directory, movie or URL.
    + Add MVI/FIL/DIR/LNK_link_to_target options to revert to the previous
      behavior (thumbnail pointing to the target).
  * Add an optional parameter to --ct to pass the strfime format instead
    of having to pass both --ct and --ctf. The old --ctf is kept for
    backward compatibility but not documented anymore.
  * Do not insert the default index title in the captions file if it is
    already defined (reported by Sebastian Schmidt in Debian bug #452945).
    + The index_title configuration options is replaced with
      index_title_default.
  * Do not escape URLs from LNK entries.
  * Use internal Perl functions instead of calling external programs when
    manipulating basic files.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sat, 15 Dec 2007 18:12:00 +0100

llgal (0.13.14)

  * Add German translation, thanks Thomas He√üling!
  * Add Italian translation, thanks Gianelle Alessio!

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sun, 18 Nov 2007 16:20:00 +0100

llgal (0.13.13)

  * Improve the speed to 'Listing entries...' dramatically
    (reported by Martin Ferrari in Debian bug #431939):
    + Retrieve image dimensions while listing entries, either with ExifTool
      if it is already needed for something else, or with Image::Size.
    + Check image validity by looking at its dimensions instead of calling
      the very slow 'identify' command.
  * Check the validity of thumbnails and scaled images too, also by looking
    at their dimensions:
    + bad user-given thumbnails or scaled images are ignored;
    + bad llgal-generated ones lead to skipping their whole entry.
  * A couple minor optimizations by caching values computed multiple times
    (image dimensions, filenames, exif tags list, ...).
  * Make sure --www changes the access rights of original images too.
  * Do not warn when the LANGUAGE environment variable is defined but empty.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sun, 08 Jul 2007 16:37:00 +0200

llgal (0.13.12)

  * Add configuration file option slide_dimensions_from_css to remove
    absolute image sizes in slides and let the user configure it from
    the CSS (requested by Olivier Schwander).
  * Fix --lang which did not work when current locale and --lang
    argument have different encodings (UTF-8 versus no UTF-8).
  * Add a warning then the LANGUAGE environment variable is defined.
    + Ship a dummy english translation so that LANGUAGE is correctly
      used when it contains an english locale.
  * Howto improvements:
    + Add how-to jump to the next slide when clicking on the current one
      (requested by Elmar Eberhardt and others).
    + Add how-to scale images and drop the originals.
    + Add a paragraph about why changing --tx without --ty (or the
      contrary) might not give the expected results since changing
      one does not affect the other one.
      - Also document all this in the manpages and llgalrc example.
    + Add a paragraph about when thumbnails or scaled images are
      regenerated and how to force it.
    + Add a paragraph about having the images in slides adapt to the
      window size using the new slide_dimensions_from_css option.
    + Minor fixes.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Tue, 17 Apr 2007 00:01:00 +0200

llgal (0.13.11)

  * Fix sorting of entries (with criteria {rev,}{time,date,size})
    in recursive mode (reported by Sebastien Mei).
  * Restore the prefetch header in the slide template.
  * Add index and contents headers to both slides and index templates.
  * Install the config file in the doc/ directory instead of /etc/llgal/
    since it only contains documentation, no actual configuration.
    + Point to it in the SEE ALSO section of llgalrc manpage.
  * Hack the parameters that are passed during Perl modules installation
    to deal with MakeMaker not using PREFIX in the common way. Without
    this change, setting PREFIX=/usr/local on the make install command
    line was installing in /usr/local/local/perl.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sat, 24 Mar 2007 01:54:00 +0100

llgal (0.13.10)

  * Fix removing of old www-pages and generation of thumbnails and
    scaled images when target directory contains special characters
    (thanks to Jeremie Koenig for the patch in Debian bug #408873).
  * Fix typo in llgalrc.5.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Mon, 29 Jan 2007 21:21:00 +0100

llgal (0.13.9)

  * Add missing double-quotes in command-lines when generating scaled
    images and thumbnails so that filenames with spaces are supported
    (reported by Florian Schlichting in Debian bug #398814).
  * Some improvements regarding the manpage:
    + Add configuration file option names near the corresponding
      command-line options
      (requested by Florian Schlichting in Debian bug #398826).
    + Add a note in CONFIGURATION about how configuration files are
      used during recursive gallery generation with -R
      (caused by Florian Schlichting's Debian bug #398826).
    + Add a manpage for llgalrc and move configuration file options
      from the main manpage into it.
    + Add install-man and uninstall-man in the Makefile to install
      manpages on demand.
    + A few fixes.
  * Some minor fixes in the comments in llgalrc.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Thu, 16 Nov 2006 21:47:00 +0100

llgal (0.13.8)

  * Drop --con and *convert_options, and replace them with more generic
    options (scaled/thumbnail_create_command) where special fields are
    replaced.
    + See the new section THUMBNAILS AND SCALED IMAGES GENERATION in
      the manpage for details.
    + Add tweak_image_generation.txt in doc/examples/ to show how to
      use it to replace convert with another image processing library
      (requested by Emmanuel Jeandel) or apply effects during image
      generation (requested somehow by Alexandre Buisse).
  * Add questions about speed and images-modification-features in the
    How-To.
  * Fix the command line that is inserted in the HTML headers by
    replacing double-quotes.
  * Add install-doc and uninstall-doc in the Makefile to help distrib
    to install documentation (requested and fixed by Alexandre Buisse).

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Thu, 09 Nov 2006 11:07:00 +0100

llgal (0.13.7)

  * Add <--SLIDE-NUMBER--> to be replaced with the slide number (with
    leading zeros), <--SLIDE-COUNTER--> to be replaced with the slide
    counter according to slide_counter_format as in the caption, and
    <!--SLIDE-TOTAL--> to be replaced by the number of slides.
  * Addition of doc/examples/ for various examples:
    + dynamic_comments_in_slides/ contains some files to explain
      "How do I let people add comments to my slides dynamically?"
      (also added to the How-To).
  * Disable the film effect by default (requested by lots of people)
    and thus change --nf to --fe to reenable it.
  * Fix W3C compliance of the film tile (reported by Jean-Claude Noel).
    + Add alt_film_tile_text configuration options to change the film
      alternative text.
  * Fix W3C compliance of horizontal lines generated with LINE entries.
  * Support building/installing only some locales by passing something
    like LOCALES="fr de" on the make command line
    (requested by Alexandre buisse).
  * Minor fixes in the manpage.
  * Fix missing Perl use (*convert_options were broken).
  * Cleanup Perl regexps.
  * Fix Perl modularization, no need to use Exporter module since we
    access modular functions by prefixing with the module name.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Thu, 19 Sep 2006 21:47:00 -0400

llgal (0.13.6)

  * Fix a major bug in slides' layout, which led to always use text-slide
    style even for images, making the margins wrong.
  * Fix the locale of gettext translations (such as "PrÈcÈdent" in French)
    by adding missing headers in the po files (thanks to Samuel Thibault
    for the fix and Nicolas GuÈnot for the report).
  * Fix linking between subgalleries when making no slides.
  * Fix computing of thumbnail row width when deciding how many thumbnails
    to output on a row, use the correct width for padded thumbnail boxes.
  * Fix missing link from listed text in the index to the corresponding
    text slide when -L is passed (reported by …milie Le Roux).
  * Fix uninitialized dimensions string when not generating any slide.
  * Fix verbose configuration option definition in recursive mode since
    it was breaking generated config file (reported by Gerfried Fuchs).
  * Fix error reporting mixed with unfinished lines (especially during
    percentage progression), and add missing errno printing and ending dot.
  * Fix configuration option line parsing error handling and displaying.
  * -L only suppresses thumbnails, not slides since the main goal was
    to create a list of subgallery links without slides, but it may be
    achieved with -L -s anyway.
    + Document how to use -L -s to create a text menu of sub-galleries
      (see the How-To file).
  * Replace link_between_last_and_first_slide with link_between_last_and_first
    and make it work with subgallery linking too
    (requested by Gerfried Fuchs in Debian bug #377780).
  * Do not link text thumbnails to a slide when not generating any slide.
  * Do not take templates in the parent .llgal directory when running in
    recursive mode, use the local ones instead (reported by Gerfried Fuchs).
    To take the parent one, --template <parent/.llgal> may be used.
  * Get captions.header from any template directory so that it works
    when installed anywhere. Add a notice message, and be sure messages
    don't mess up with the on-going caption generation percentage.
  * Do not load Image::ExifTool unless required by --exif, --cc or --ct
    (requested by Alexandre Buisse).
  * Add a CSS style for captions (requested by Alexandre Buisse).
  * Add the command line options to the generated slides, and to the
    captions file (on both creation and appending)
  * Add <!--VERSION--> to the list of replaced fields, without immediately
    using it for now.
  * Add empty lines around the captions headers in the generated captions
    file.
  * Document how to prevent llgal from erasing the captions file
    (see the How-To file).
  * Add the date to the program name when compiling it from SVN.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sun, 03 Sep 2006 11:26:00 -0400

llgal (0.13.5)

  * When linking to galleries, add the index filename to the URL so
    that these links work even without a web server
    (thanks to Michael Waschb¸sch for the patch).
  * Document how to add keyboard shortcuts to the gallery with
    HTML accesskeys (see the How-To file).
  * Various fix for links to previous/next galleries:
    + Only keep the last part of the path to generate the name that
      is used in links to prev/next galleries.
    + Fix broken PREV/NEXT: entry generation in the gallery.
    + Fix links to prev/next galleries when the current gallery current
      both some subdirectories and regular files.
    + Drop --prev/next-gal and {prev,next}_gallery_link{,_target} since
      only the captions file is more suited to configure this.
      {prev,next}_gallery_link_text remains to configure the link text prefix.
  * Document --parent-gal options in the usage since it is
    not internal anymore (reported by Samuel Thibault).

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Thu, 04 Jul 2006 23:41:00 -0400

llgal (0.13.4)

  * --exif without argument shows all exif tags that exist in the image.
  * Add --Pall (and recursive_sections) to create a section of images
    for each subdirectory as if -P was used for each of them.
  * Add entitle_sections configuration option to explicitely enable the
    generation of a title for each section. separate_sections now only
    configures the generation of a horizontal line.
    --Ps still enables both.
  * Add REPLACE keyword in the captions for a configurable replacement
    in the HTML pages (requested by Alexandre Buisse).
  * -v is now --verbose (and verbose configuration option has been added).
    + Add/convert some messages to be printed when --verbose is passed.
    + --version is now -V.
  * Improve replacement of <!--FOO--> fields when generating the slides
    and index HTML pages.
    + More tiny optimizations of the HTML slide and index generation by
      precomputing more fields.
  * Add link_between_last_and_first_slide configuration option to
    disable the links between the last and first slides.
  * Fix generation of configuration file when an old has to be renamed.
  * Fix image title and alternative in HTML slides.
  * Some fixes in the manpage.
  * Update captions.header with last caption entry types.
  * Add a doc/ subdirectory:
    + The How-To is now also included in the tarball.
    + UPGRADE is now HTML'ized as upgrade.html.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Thu, 11 May 2006 11:40:00 +0200

llgal (0.13.3)

  * Add -P (and section_dir) to use photos in a special subdirectory
    instead of the working directory. May be used multiple times to create
    a unique gallery with photos from several subdirectories
    (requested by Samuel Mimram and Samuel Thibault).
    + Add --Ps (separate_sections) to automaticaly add BREAK and TXT
      entries at the beginning of each section.
  * When -n is passed, slide filename is generated from the image filename
    and the slide filename prefix (it helps cleaning HTML files).
    + Add a note about slide_filenameprefix == "" which could lead to removal
      of non-llgal HTML files.
  * When -L is passed, TXT entries are listed without thumbnails in the index,
    but they still appear as a slide (it will help creating sections).
  * Fix several operations on thumbnails and scaled images when -d is passed.
  * Do not waste time in ExifTool when there's nothing to do (do not read tags
    when none is required, and initialize on demand).
  * Optimize slide generation a little bit by pre-computing fields before
    actually filling the template.
  * Improve percentage printing for progression.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sun, 30 Apr 2006 23:31:00 +0200

llgal (0.13.2)

  * --cf now does not include the filename extension in the caption
    (requested by Alexandre Buisse).
    + make_caption_from_extension may be used to add the extension
      as previously.
  * Support subdirectory images that the user may add to the gallery
    by inserting their path in the captions file.
    + Thumbnails and scaled image filenames are generated after replacing
      the path separator (/) with the new configurable
      path_separator_replacement.
  * Do not create a thumbnail or scaled image if the original is already
    smaller than the maximal dimensions.
  * Fix -h/--help.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Thu, 27 Apr 2006 00:32:00 +0200

llgal (0.13.1)

  * Force regeneration of thumbnails and scaled when the original image
    has been modified since their creation.
  * Fix --option (reported by Alexandre Buisse).

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Tue, 18 Apr 2006 16:51:00 -0700

llgal (0.13)

  * Add --exif (and show_exif_tags) to display a table of exif tags under
    each image slide (requested by Alexandre Buisse). The layout is defined
    by <!--EXIF-TABLE--> in the slide template and some new CSS styles.
  * Replace show_no_slide_counter in the configuration file with
    slide_counter_format where %n, %0n and %t will be replaced dynamically.
    The old show_no_slide_counter now corresponds to slide_counter_format="".
    + By default, the slide counter gets leading zeros
      (requested by Alexandre Buisse).
  * Add the BREAK keyword to be used in captions file to force a line break
    in a row of thumbnails (requested by Alexandre Buisse).
  * Improve slide filename:
    + Change default prefix to 'slide_'.
    + Drop slide_filenameprefix_nofile and use slide_filename_prefix for
      slides that have no file associated with them.
    + Add leading zeros to the number in the slide filename.
  * By default, thumbnail width is now limited (113px).
    + When a thumbnail_max_width is defined, force all thumbnail boxes
      to this width by padding the thumbnail.
    + The previous behavior (unlimited width and unpadded thumbnails) may
      be restored with thumbnail_width_max=0.
  * Replace --bigxy and --bigy with --sx and --sy to reduce slide images.
  * Replace --xy and -y with --tx and --ty to change thumbnail size.
  * Replace -r with --nf to omit film effect in the index.
  * Drop -t option to change the film time effect height (filmtile_height)
    since the layout does not need it anymore. The user may easily change
    the film tile image without having llgal do it.
  * Fix the film effect when the tile image size is modified by forcing the
    height of the row to be exactly the height of the image. We could use
    nice CSS to do so, but Internet Explorer CSS support sucks too much.
  * Use $(MAKE) instead of make in recursive invocation in the Makefile
    (FreeBSD breakage reported by George Wood).
  * Use Image::ExifTool instead of Image::Infos (thanks to Alexandre Buisse).
  * Do not remove all html files on --clean and when regenerating the gallery,
    but only those files that match index filename or slide filename prefix
    (requested by Alexandre Buisse).
  * Do not scale image when smaller than the thumbnail.
  * Do not warn when the local llgal directory is ignored outside of early
    configuration if the value would not actually change.
  * Fix slide numbering depending on LINE entries.
  * Fix a warning about an uninitialized value being used when --ct without
    any timestamp available (reported by Alexandre Buisse).
  * Fix a warning about an uninitialized value being used when the gallery
    is empty.
  * Perl-modularization.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sun, 16 Apr 2006 19:53:00 -0400

llgal (0.12.2)

  * Add --lang and --codeset to change the locale or encoding (and the
    corresponding language and codeset configuration option). --lang
    appears to not work if the LANGUAGE environment variable is set.
  * -L now lists links between the thumbnail rows according to the order of
    the entries. Listing at the end is still possible by moving the entries
    at the end of the captions file.
  * Add the LINE keyword to be used in captions file to generate a horizontal
    line.
  * Recursion is now processed in the same process, enabling future shared
    information between galleries for improved links.
    + Remove --indent internal option.
    + Keep --parent/prev/next-gal in case the user wants to override them.
  * Cleanup and improve configuration file generation:
    + Do not export unmodified options since it would prevent a default
      modification to be seen.
    + If the configuration file to create already exists, rename it with
      with the current timestamp and generate a new one.
    + Add the current timestamp to the generated configuration file.
    + The special target "local" creates .llgal/llgalrc in the destination
      directory.
    + When recursive, "local" generates a configuration file in all subdirs
      while not "local" only generates in the working directory.
    + Print a message when generating.
  * Large rework of configuration parsing:
    + Additional files passed with --config or additional_configuration_file
      are parsed as soon as the option is met, before processing any of the
      following options.
    + Avoid parsing a configuration file multiple times in case of recursive
      galleries.
    + Cleanup and improve option checking, with better error reporting:
      - Options that are not a string must now be numeric.
  * make_recursive configuration option is now called recursive.
  * Replace template_dir with additional_template_dir in configuration file
    and move it to various options together with additional_configuration_file.
  * Restrict directory configuration to cleanup the code:
    + Remove llgal_share_dir and user_share_dir since additional_template_dir
      is enough.
    + The local llgal directory name may be changed only by the system-wide
      (/etc/llgal/llgalrc) or the user-wide file ($HOME/.llgal/llgalrc).
  * Replace <br> in the generated HTML with margins in the CSS.
  * User-provided scaled images are also used in slides even if --bigy/--bigxy
    was not passed (no scaled images).
  * When the local llgal directory name is changed (with local_llgal_directory)
    the local configuration file is read from the corresponding directory, not
    from .llgal/.
  * Hardcode default english values in usage to avoid messing the code.
  * Don't forget to remove the templates that might have been gotten in the
    local llgal directory (with --gt) and not been modified.
  * Remove useless buggy print in captions generation.
  * Fix manpage additional_configuration_file name (instead of config_file).
  * Fix slide_height_max processing.
  * Fix some special cases in --www.
  * Some cleanups.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Tue,  7 Mar 2006 22:44:00 -0500

llgal (0.12.1)

  * Set HTML encoding header depending on the locale with the new LLGAL-CODESET
    replace pattern in the templates (reported by Marcus Better in Debian bug
    #343546).
  * Really really parse command-line options after configuration files.
  * Pass -w to perl interpreter and fix several warnings.
  * Add a "requested by" in the Changes.
  * Document LLGAL-OPTIONS replace pattern in the manpage.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Wed, 21 Dec 2005 00:59:26 -0500

llgal (0.12)

  * Add internationalization support for the text that is automatically
    embedded in the HTML pages. See LANGUAGE in the manpage for details.
  * Add french translation.
  * Support custom thumbnails for all file-based entries with the mythumb_
    prefix (and an additional image extension for non-images) in the .llgal
    directory (requested by Sebastien Mei).
  * Support custom scaled images for all file-based entries with the myscaled_
    prefix (and an additional image extension for non-images) in the .llgal
    directory.
  * Add credits_text option and replace CREDITS in the templates.
  * Add bmp to default image extenstions and ogm and wmv to movie when
    scanning the working directory.
  * image_extensions and movie_extensions are now explicitely a |-separated
    list without regexp inside.
  * Fix -d and -R by checking the destination directory after -d has been
    parsed (reported by Marcus Better in Debian bug #329168). This is done by
    parsing -d very early, which is required since it changes the location of
    the local configuration file (hopefully, it cannot be overridden in a
    configuration file).
  * Cleanup destination directory name printing.
  * Major cleanup of the manpage.
  * Minor fix in the README.
  * Typos in the Changes.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Thu, 15 Dec 2005 12:47:26 -0500

llgal (0.11.4)

  * Really parse command-line options after configuration files
    (thanks to Dave Holland in Debian bug #340315).
  * Trailing spaces and other small cleanups.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Tue, 22 Nov 2005 13:18:26 -0500

llgal (0.11.3)

  * Add --uc and css_location to use a CSS style-sheet that is already
    available on the web.
  * Add --ui to use images for filmtile and links that are available on
    the web.
    + Add filmtile_location, index_link_image_location,
      prev_slide_link_image_location and next_slide_link_image_location
      for a per-image configuration.
  * Fix -d with an absolute directory.
  * Fix --option which was broken since last release.
    + Do not show usage after the error message when a --option parameter
      could not be parsed.
  * Fix missing update of sanity checks, numerical options processing,
    and various other options that were broken since previous release
    (reported by Hanus Adler in Debian bug #337380).
  * Do not parse behavior options at the beginning since there's no more
    any reason. Command line options are thus processed after all
    configuration files. This makes -f work if a config file contains
    force_image_regeneration = 0
    (reported by Hanus Adler in Debian bug #337380).
  * Rename tile_height with filmtile_height for consistency.
  * Fix percentage printing by showing both entry listing and preparing.

llgal (0.11.2)

  * Add --php to generate webpages with the php extension instead of html
    (requested by David Baelde). Templates are still named with the html
    extensions. The www_extension configuration option also enables
    extension configuration.
    The -i option (index_filename) thus now takes a filename without
    extension.
  * -R now implies -S (suggested by Brian Donlan's Debian bug #329168):
  * When called with -d, llgal only reads the llgalrc configuration file
    in the destination directory since the local one may be easily added
    through --config.
  * Add recursive --gt (give templates to all subdirectories).
  * Slides without file now have they slide_filename numbered with the
    number of the slide for make_slide_filename_from_filename (-n)
    instead of starting from 1.
  * Add prev_gallery_link_target to split enabling and target. Add missing
    documentation for prev/next_gallery_link[_text]/link_subgalleries and
    fix option processing.
  * Add force_image_regeneration configuration option for -f.
  * Rework the internal code to easy multiple gallery generation
    in the same process.
  * Reorganize usage and manpage with an 'additional behavior' and
    'selecting files' sections.
  * Add TEMPLATES section in the manpage to document the replacement
    of fields when generating webpages from the templates.
  * Update all contact addresses and URLs since the project is
    now hosted by Gna!.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Thu, 22 Sep 2005 10:00:00 +0200

llgal (0.11.1)

  * Rename /etc/llgalrc to /etc/llgal/llgalrc. Also read ~/.llgal/llgalrc
    and .llgal/llgalrc.
    + Warn if an old file is found, and skip it.
  * Add --li and --lt options to replace link labels in slides with
    image (requested by Cyrill Helg):
    + index.png, prev.png and next.png are added to show arrows for --li.
    + A thumbnail is shown to preview prev/next slide (if IMG) for --lt.
    + slidetemplate is a little bit modified.
      - The Index link is now _betwee_ Prev and Next.
    + The css template is a little bit extended.
    + Add configurable text that is shown when the mouse pointer
      is over these links.
  * Allow to change the label of links to index/prev/next in slides
    with prev/next_slide/index_link_text.
  * Add --Rl to add links between subgalleries.
    + Add --next/prev-gal internal options to set links to prev/next
      galleries.
  * Write the title and parent/prev/next gallery in the captions file when
    generating. Update them when appending (without removing the previous
    definition if it exists).
    + Add PARENT/PREV/NEXT captions line for gallery links.
  * Rename parent_link* to parent_gallery_link*. Replace --parent with
    --parent-gal and undocument in --help (keep in manpage).
  * Rename _linktext options to _link_text.
  * Remove no_default_link_text since link text values might be
    modified at runtime, and also after captions generation.
  * Rename MVI/FIL/DIR_default_link_text to MVI/FIL/DIR_link_text.
  * Remove --sp and --tp command line options, keeping their configuration
    options (scaled_image_filenameprefix and thumbnail_image_filenameprefix).
  * One more reorganization of options in llgalrc and generated config files.
    Hope this one will be fine.
  * Fix compilation and installation when DESTDIR is overridden.
  * Fix and cleanup documentation and Makefile.

llgal (0.11)

  * The local llgal directory is now .llgal instead of .llgal.files.
    + A warning is shown if .llgal.files exists.
  * Add -L and list_links to list links after the gallery index instead of
    creating slides and thumbnails (requested by David Baelde).
  * All links in the index directly open the target instead of the slide,
    not only MVI and FIL (requested by Samuel Thibault).
  * The captions file is now automatically used if it exists
    (-c option got removed).
  * Improved usage of image comments for captions:
    + use JFIF/GIF comment by default
      (closes Wolfram Quester's Debian bug #324478).
    + support array of strings in JFIF comment.
    + remove \000 in JFIF comment.
    + make_caption_from_image_comment is now a string option of comma
      separated fields:

      - each type is tried until one returns a non-empty value.
      - basic types maybe combined with a plus to concat their values.
    + update --cc option behavior:
      - no argument means default (std before exif).
      - 0 means no caption from comment.
      - any other string defines make_caption_from_image_comment.
  * Cleanup title of image, alternatives, ...
    + Add over_scaled/thumbnail_text configuration options to change texts
      that are shown when the mouse pointer is over images.
      - Add "Click to enlarge" default prefix for thumbnails.
    + Add alt_scaled/thumbnail/full_text configuration options to change
      alternatives prefix, and add defaults.

    + Add title to links in the index and in slides.
    + Remove colon between image title prefix and image.

    + When possible, the HTML title parameter is in href instead of img.
  * Cleanup location and copying of special llgal files
    (requested by LoÔs Taulelle) :
    + index/slidetemplate.html are not copied to .llgal anymore.
    + The user might put a special revision of index/slidetemplate.html
      in .llgal, llgal will use it.
    + Add --gt option to copy templates in the local, user or any
      other template directory.
    + Add --templates option (add template_dir configuration option)

  * Move several text configuration options to a common Text section in
    llgalrc and in the manpage.
    + Add a LANGUAGE section in the manpage for changing text options.

  * Spaces are now supported in convert options.
  * Check for -h or -v earlier.
  * Add .tif[f] and .mov to default image and movie extensions
    (requested by Cyrill Helg).

  * Fix bogus check of .llgal.files attributes.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Sat, 20 Aug 2005 01:32:55 +0200

llgal (0.10.1)

  * Rework the text that is shown in links (MVI, FIL and DIR types)
    by default (when no captions file exists):
    - Show the extension, not only the filename.
    - Add an prefix text depending on the link type.
    - Add MVI/FIL/DIR_default_linktext options to change this text.
    - Add no_default_text option so that this text is not shown
      (only the filename is shown).
  * Document and improve link to parent gallery in subgalleries:
    - make_parent option adds a header and a footer linking to the parent
      (like --parent).
    - parent_linktext option changes the text in these links.
  * Add an UPGRADE file to document upgrading galleries from igal to llgal.
  * Cleanup a few stuff in the CSS.

 -- Brice Goglin <Brice.Goglin@ens-lyon.org>  Fri, 19 Aug 2005 16:42:10 +0200

llgal (0.10)

  * Add the FIL type for files that are neither an image nor a movie. FIL is similar
    to LNK, but the file size is shown since it can be locally accessed.
  * Improve scanning of files in the working directory when no captions file exists:
    - By default, only images and movies are added to the gallery.
    - Add image/movie_extensions options to change which files are
      recognized as images or movies.
    - Add -A to force addition of all files to the gallery, not only images an movies.
    - Add -S to force addition of all subdirectories to the gallery.
    - Add --exclude and --include to remove or re-add files to the list of processed
      files in the working directory. Multiple instances are allowed and the order
      is respected.
    - Add --sort to sort with another criteria than name.
    - Sort filenames before creating entries so that slide numbering does not become
      wrong later.
  * -R now does only run recursively in subdirectories, it does not scan existing
    subdirectories in the working directory anymore:
    - If no captions file exists, -R should now be used together with -S to both define
      the list of subdirectories and then process them recursively.
    - If a captions file exists, all subdirectories that it defines are processed
      when -R is passed.
  * convert options are now converted into an array, spaces inside options are not supported for now.
  * Check that additional configuration files (--config <file>) exist and are regular files.
  * Fix captions file header.
  * Fix Debian tarball generation.
  * Fix typos in the README.
  * Remove version number in slidetemplate.html since it's useless and never up-to-date.

  * Cleanup system usage and error reporting.
  * Use -s to get file size.
  * Use _ to optimize consecutive file test operations.
  * A few typos.
